## Code Explanation <a name='code-explanation'></a>
The provided code is a simplified version of the Nebula FX trading robot. It includes necessary libraries and defines constants. The main functions of the code are as follows:

- `OnTick()`: This function is executed on every new tick in the market. It checks the current market trend, generates trading signals based on trend validity and strength, executes trades based on the generated signals, and manages risk.
- `GenerateSignal()`: This function generates trading signals based on the current trend analysis. If the trend is up, it generates a buy signal. If the trend is down, it generates a sell signal. Otherwise, it generates no signal.
- `ExecuteTrade()`: This function opens or closes trades based on the generated signals. It checks the total number of open trades and executes buy or sell trades if the signal is valid and the maximum number of trades has not been reached. It also closes all trades if there are no valid signals.
- `ManageRisk()`: This function manages risk and minimizes potential losses. It calculates the stop loss and target price for each open trade and adjusts them accordingly.
- `CloseAllTrades()`: This function closes all open trades.
- `OnDeinit()`: This function is executed before the program is stopped. It closes all open trades before deinitializing.
- `OnInit()`: This function is executed when the program starts. It initializes the trade and series objects and sets the symbol and period for trend analysis.
- `OnStart()`: This function runs the program by calling the `OnTick()` function.
